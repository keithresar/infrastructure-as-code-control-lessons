# Creating a Credential

Credentials are utilized by Tower for authentication when launching Jobs against machines, synchronizing 
with inventory sources, and importing project content from a version control system.

You can grant users and teams the ability to use these credentials, without actually exposing the credential 
to the user. If you have a user move to a different team or leave the organization, you donâ€™t have to re-key 
all of your systems just because that credential was available in Tower.

### ðŸ’ª  Exercise 4.2 Creating a Machine Credential

Machine credentials enable Tower to invoke Ansible on hosts under your management. Just like using Ansible on 
the command line, you can specify the SSH username, optionally provide a password, an SSH key, a key password, 
or even have Tower prompt the user for their password at deployment time. They define ssh and user-level privilege 
escalation access for playbooks, and are used when submitting jobs to run playbooks on a remote host.

Get started by navigating to the credentials page:

 - Click the **Settings** gear icon on the top-right of the screen
 - Click **Credentials**

Add a new credential with the following properties:

 - **Name** - `Control Server - studentX` (replace with your unique student username)
 - **Credential Type** - Machine
 - **Username** - `studentX` (replace with your unique student username)
 - **Password** - Your unique password
 - *The remaining fields can be left as is*

Click **Save**.

Verify who has access to this credential by clicking on the **Permissions** link.
