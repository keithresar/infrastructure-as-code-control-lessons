# Ansible Beyond Linux

The first Ansible modules were more unix and Linux focussed, but over the past several years
the community has made tremendous investment so we can truly automate all the things.
Take a quick review of the major categories where ansible has significant penetration:

True, our workshop so far has focussed a simple example managing Linux workstations, but what
you’ve learned can be instantly re-applied to other platforms.  As you have no doubt seen,
the documentation for all 1400+ modules all follows the same format.  This means even if you
aren’t familiar with Windows, API integration, or Network appliances, you can still effectively
automate them with ansible.

In this section we explore beyond Linux, with:

 - Microsoft Windows automation
 - API integration with a ticketing system

Proceed to the next exercise to continue.
