# Baseline Performance

We now have all the parts configured for the Translation Wizard MVP.
In subsequent exercises we will modify our environment architecture to achieve better performance

In this last exercise we will get a baseline performance on which to build.

### Exercise 3.13 Execute Apache Benchmarking Tool

The tool `ab` should already be installed on your development workstation.  This tool ships with the
Apache httpd web server and it  is  designed  to give  you  an  impression  of how your current Apache 
installation performs. This especially shows you how many requests per second your Apache installation 
is capable of serving.

The endpoint we want to hit is shown below (change to the IP address for your web server of course)

```
curl http://10.10.10.92/api.php?url=http://www.redhat.com
```

Execute a test with 10 requests and record your results.

*Note - please don't perform hundreds or thousands of requests as our API key only gives the whole class
5000 requests to share for the entire course!*


** Post State **

Your output should resemble the following:

```
> ab -n 10 http://10.10.10.77/api.php?url=http://www.redhat.com
