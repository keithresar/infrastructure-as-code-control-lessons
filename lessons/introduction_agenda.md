# Getting Started Agenda

Today is meant for anyone who has any exposure to Ansible, whether you have used it or 
not. The format of this discussion is a combination of presentation, demonstration, and 
hands-on labs.

Your Responsibilities:
 
- **Have a discussion**. This will be boring if itâ€™s just us up here talking the entire time.
- **Participate**. We are going to cut you loose with Ansible here in just a little while. 
- **Have questions**
- **Have opinions**
  
Hopefully you have your laptop with you. If not, please find a shoulder-surfing buddy.

In this section we focus on getting everyone access to the lab environment and we introduce
two of the core files used within the Ansible environment.

 - Connecting to the Control Server
 - Introducing Ansible.cfg
 - Inventories

Proceed to the next exercise to continue.
