### Exercise 3.5  Getting Setup

** Working Directory **

All work moving for the rest of the class will build on the previous exercise.

Your work will all reside within the `translation_wizard/` directory.

If you need a little help along the way you may reference the solutions that exist for every
exercise inside the `translation_wizard_SOLUTIONS/` directory.

** Working files **

Wherever possible we request you create an Ansible **Role** to package your automation rather than
writing everything directly inside of a single playbook.

Your final playbooks version should all reside in the existing `main.yml` file.

To ease testing (especially as you get to later exercises) you may want to create alternate files for
an easier *inner-loop* development instead of executing all of `main.yml`.  Alternately, effective use
of **[tags](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_tags.html)** will allow you to develop more maintainable code overall.

** Your First Practical Steps **

Change to the `translation_wizard/` directory.

Create a new role called `web`.

Include this role in your `main.yml` playbook.
