# Translation Wizard

Now it's time to start automating for real.

For the remainder of the exercises we the instructions will be far less explicit.  This is
designed so you pull up resources to learn, discuss possible solutions and dead ends with
your peers, and ultimately bring an environment to full functionality.

In this section you will deploy a microservices application called the **Translation Wizard**.
It includes:

- A web server providing a web interface
- An API server hosting a container running an API
- An external microservice called LanguageLayer

Proceed to the next exercise to continue.
