# Environment Access

All of your activity during this and subsequent labs occurs on a bastion node.  The bastion
node is a Red Hat Linux server that:

 - Has the Ansible toolset installed
 - Hosts the web-based IDE you'll use to modify files
 - Is where all automation activities are initiated
 - Is your virtual home for the rest of the training

Todayâ€™s workshop infrastructure is being run in a cloud environment.
Each student will be assigned a number, e.g. student1, student2, student3.
 
Your instructor will supply you with an **Access Guide** printout (or pdf)
where you will find **lot** of detailed info for your own personal lab environment.

 - Bastion - used to develop and run Ansible playbooks, hosts Eclipse CHE web-IDE, hosts the lesson
   guide you're reading
 - Web and API Servers - your personal targets for all Ansible playbooks
 - Shared resources such as Ansible Tower (job runner), Gitlab (for SCM), Image Registry (to store docker
   container images), HashiCorp Vault (secret store), and F5 LTM (load balancer).
 - Many URLs, public IP addresses, and private IP addresses.  In general use the private IP addresses
   for communication within the lab and public IP addresses only when you as a student need to access
   a resource.  Most exercises will clearly show which is needed.
 - Username, password - used to authenticate to all servers.  Each participant has a unique login.
   Please only use your login to prevent unintended errors for other students

**All exercises should be performed using Google Chrome or Firefox on VDI**.  Microsoft IE and Edge
have not been performing as expected.

### Exercise 1.1 - Grant Access to bastion Server

In general this class is not about security, nor have we architected the environment in a way that
aligns to good corporate information security best practices.  In an effort to reduce any friction
that may stand in the way of your learning we have limited SSL use and employed easy to remember
passwords.

To mitigate the risk of someone breaking the public-facing lab environments, we have limited external
access to your bastion server.  

You will need to execute an Ansible playbook from the Ansible Towerserver to enable access.

First, navigate to this URL and take note of the public IP address for the workstation/VDI endpoint
you will use for the remainder of the lessons.  Notate this IP address in your paper **Access Guide**
or elsewhere as appropriate.

https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+my+ip

Second, take note of your personal student number from your environment **Access Guide**.

Now, navigate to the Ansible Tower URL and login using your supplied credentials.

Once you successfully login you will see the dashboard screen:

<img src="/images/introduction/awx_dashboard.png" style="margin-left:2em;max-width:90%;">

Click on the **Templates** link in the sidebar nav, then click the rocket icon to the right of the
**Bootstrap Access** template.

A survey data collector window will pop up.  Provide the following then click **Next**:

* **Student IP Address** - The public IP address associated with your workstation/VDI that you just
  noted
* **Student Number** - The number that follows the word `student` in the **User** section throughout
  your Access Guide.

Verify the data you submitted then click **Launch**.

Wait for the Ansible Tower job to complete.  This job is finalizing the configuration for your
personal lab environment.

Seek assistance if the job has errors.

Scroll through the log output and take note of the CHE Workspace URL provided.  It should look
like ```http://ipaddress:8080/```.  Eclipse CHE is the web-based IDE that will be used for the all
exercises beginning with section 2.


### â˜¢ Exercise 1.1 Results

Take note of the CHE Workspace URL from the log output of the Ansible job you just executed.



### Exercise 1.2 - Access CHE Workspace

While it is possible to complete all activities directly from the Linux command line on your bastion host, such
as by running Ansible playbooks and modifying files with the `vi` editor, this isn't the only way.  

Our course makes use of the [Eclipse CHE Web-based IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/che/) which provides file 
editing, syntax highlighting, git source code management, and a browser-based terminal from which to execute 
your Ansible playbooks.

In this exercise we will verify you can access your workspace and that it works as expected.

Navigate to your CHE Workspace using the URL from exercise 1.1 (a link to the same URL should also exist in
your Access Guide).  You should see a screen like the one below.

<img src="/images/introduction/che_dashboard.png" style="margin-left:2em;max-width:90%;">

Click on the **ansible** link at the bottom of the sidebar.  You may need to wait while your workspace
completes loading and building.  Your CHE workspace is backed by a container dedicated to your
automation work throughout this training.

<img src="/images/introduction/che_workspace_loading.png" style="margin-left:2em;max-width:90%;">

Once the workspace loads you should see a screen like the following:

<img src="/images/introduction/che_workspace.png" style="margin-left:2em;max-width:90%;">

While an IDE is an incredibly powerful piece of software, your first introduction to it can be quite
intimidating.  We won't make use of most of the included functionality.  Instead, take specific note
of the three areas where we'll be working:

* **1 - File Browser**.  Expand the file tree to open existing files or create new files
* **2 - Editor Pane**.  Each open file gets its own tab in this pane.  Changes are automatically saved
* **3 - Terminal**.  Click on the terminal tab to get access to a shell where you can run Ansible.
  You can access your files in the terminal  by changing to the directory `cd /projects/infrastructure-as-code-lab`.

### â˜¢ Exercise 1.2 Results

The exercise is complete once you can:

* Access your CHE workspace
* Select a file from the browser pane and open it in the editor pane
* Open the terminal and change to your project directory

Seek assistance if you run into issues with any of the above, or if the display is not rendering
as expected.  If you see a rendering issue in the terminal like in the screenshot below you will
need to use Putty to ssh to your target server.
