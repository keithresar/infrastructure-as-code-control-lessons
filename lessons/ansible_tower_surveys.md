# Adding Surveys to Your Template

Job types of Run or Check will provide a way to set up surveys in the Job Template creation 
or editing screens. Surveys set extra variables for the playbook similar to ‚ÄòPrompt for Extra 
Variables‚Äô does, but in a user-friendly question and answer way. Surveys also allow for validation 
of user input. Click the survey button to create a survey.

Use cases for surveys are numerous. An example might be if operations wanted to give developers 
a ‚Äúpush to stage‚Äù button they could run without advanced Ansible knowledge. When launched, this task 
could prompt for answers to questions such as, ‚ÄúWhat tag should we release?‚Äù

Many types of questions can be asked, including multiple-choice questions.
