# Introducing ansible.cfg

Certain settings in Ansible are adjustable via a configuration file written in the `.ini` format.
The stock configuration should be sufficient for most users, but there may be reasons you would want to change them.

Changes can be made and used in a configuration file which will be processed in the following order:

 - `ANSIBLE_CONFIG` (an environment variable)
 - `ansible.cfg` (in the current directory)
 - `.ansible.cfg` (in the home directory)
 - `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`

Ansible will process the above list and use the first file found. Settings in files are not merged.

### ðŸ’ª  Exercise 1.1- Review ansible.cfg

To ease setup, and because our lab environment is so simple, we have created a basic `ansible.cfg` file for
you which is located in your `/projects/infrastructure-as-code/` directory.  We will use mostly the defaults
except for a couple of values.

From CHE, open the `ansible.cfg` file.  It should contain the following lines:

```
[defaults]
retry_files_enabled = False
host_key_checking = False
inventory= inventory
private_key_file=files/student-ssh-public-key

[ssh_connection]
ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
```

Notice this file is written in the `.ini` format which allows for a number of key/value pairs inside 
groups (denoted by square brackets).

The three values above accomplish the following:

 - **retry_files_enabled** - Disable failed automation recovery
 - **host_key_checking** - This is a lab, so do not verify trust
 - **inventory** - This points to the static inventory file that we explore in exercise 2.2



### â˜¢ Exercise 2.1 Results

Review `ansible.cfg` file.  Explore the full list of configuration directives from the
[Ansible configuration](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_configuration.html)
site.  This is a huge list, and while not used within a lab environment, there are hundreds of
tunables that make sure Ansible plays well with your existng environment.
