# Git Introduction

Version control is a key component to successfully supporting an infrastructure as code culture.
Git is a decentralized VCS which truly enables a new flexibility in collaboration that was never
fully available with more traditional Enterprise VCS solutions such as cvs, svn, tfs, and others.

Git is an incredibly powerful tool and it is grown substantially since Linux Torvalds first wrote it
during a weekend of programming back in 2005.  Many companies have been established to add value
throughout the git lifecycle.  

As this is merely an introduction rather than an in-depth review, we'll focus on some specific and
most commonly used functionality.
