# Git Introduction

Version control is a key component to successfully supporting an infrastructure as code culture.
Git is a decentralized VCS which truly enables a new flexibility in collaboration that was never
fully available with more traditional Enterprise VCS solutions such as cvs, svn, tfs, and others.

Git is an incredibly powerful tool and it is grown substantially since Linux Torvalds first wrote it
during a weekend of programming back in 2005.  Many companies have been established to add value
throughout the git lifecycle.  

As this is merely an introduction rather than an in-depth review, we'll focus on some specific and
most commonly used functionality.

###  Exercise 2.19 - Exploring a git playground

This entire exercise will be completed inside your terminal.

Please change to a new directory outside of the project space where you've been working so far.

```
> cd
> mkdir test-repo
```

**Creating a new repository**

Git operates locally and its entire database exists within you the project's root directory.
This allows you to have multiple different projects, each residing in their own directory.

To create a new git repository called `test-repo` issue the following command:

```
> git init .
```


**Adding and staging files**



**Committing changes**



**Creating branches**



**Merging changes**



**Cleanup**


When you complete the exercise please change back to your project directory

```
> cd /projects/infrastructure-as-code
```
