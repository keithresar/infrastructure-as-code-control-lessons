# Hardening Your Defaults

Up to now your experience should have been pleasantly easy.  That's because there are no firewall
ACLs in place that affect traffic flows between the Internet, your web server, and your app servers.

Ansible is an excellent tool for managing ACLs - whether they be on a traditional device like a Checkpoint
firewall or on something newer like an AWS Security Group.

In this section we will harden your current configuration, break everything that's currently working,
then over subsequent exercises will regain just enough access for functionality.

all fails in your environment.
